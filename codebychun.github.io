    <p>Douglas Engelbart (January 30, 1925 – July 2, 2013) was an American engineer and visionary whose groundbreaking work laid the foundation for modern interactive computing. Born in Oregon, he dedicated his career to exploring how computers could be used to augment human intelligence and enhance problem-solving capabilities. Engelbart’s innovative research led to the creation of the computer mouse, hypertext, and early networked computing systems. His ideas and inventions have had a lasting impact on the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). His pioneering demonstrations, notably "The Mother of All Demos" in 1968, showcased technologies that would revolutionize computing.</p>
    
    <h2>Contributions to HCI</h2>
    <p>Engelbart's work transformed the way humans interact with computers, shifting the focus from machines as mere calculators to tools that amplify human potential. He introduced intuitive interfaces and devices, such as the mouse, that have become standard in modern computing. His visionary approach emphasized collaboration and networked communication, foreseeing the interconnected digital world we live in today. Engelbart’s research established key principles for interactive computing that continue to influence HCI design and technology development. His legacy endures in every aspect of user interface design and digital collaboration tools used around the globe.</p>
